        <h>What is the define directive</h>

        <p>
            The <cb>#define</cb> directive is used to create constant values that exist at compile-time.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h>How to use</h>

        <p>
            The define directive follows the syntax of <cb>#define from [to] as [name]</cb>. You can also use <cb>#define from [to]</cb>, and the <cb>[name]</cb> of the macro will be the same as the <cb>from</cb>.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h>What is a macro</h>

        <p>
            A macro is a token that is substituted for another value at compile time.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h>Example:</h>
        <pre>
#define x [500] as [x]

console.log(x);
</pre>

        <p>This will compile to:</p>

        <pre>
console.log(500);
</pre>
        <br><br>
        <h>Looping during compilation</h>

        <p>
            During compilation, the application of macros will loop until there are no changes. This means the following is possible:
        </p>

        <pre>
#define x [500]
#define y [x + 200]

console.log(y);
</pre>

        <p>This will compile to:</p>

        <pre>
console.log(500 + 200);
</pre>
    </div>
</body>
