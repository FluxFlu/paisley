@replaceLines

#The replaceLine function

The `replaceLine` function is used to call a function on a specific line of a multi-line string.

It follows the syntax `replaceLine(block, line, replaceWith)`.

For example, if the following block were passed to the function along with a `line` of `0` and a `replaceWith` of `(line) => "[ " + line`,

```
const x = "Hello, world!";

console.log(x);
```

The result would be as follows:

```
[ const x = "Hello, world!";

console.log(x);
```
