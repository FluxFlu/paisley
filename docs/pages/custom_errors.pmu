@Custom Errors

#Why custom errors?

Paisley includes many features, such as procedures and cooking, that require code to be executed at compile-time rather than runtime.

Oftentimes, this code will have the potential to be used improperly. When that happens, the code should throw an error.

Custom error features exist to help Paisley developers create readable errors that are in-line with the expectations of those using their code.
