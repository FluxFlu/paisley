        <h>What is cooking?</h>

        <p>Cooking is the term for evaluating code at compile time rather than runtime using angle braces <cb>$&lt;&gt;</cb>.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h>An example of cooking</h>
        <p>
            Both of the following blocks of code do the same thing. They both print 400.
        </p>
        <pre>
#define x [200]
console.log(x + 200);
</pre>
        <pre>
#define x [200]
console.log($&lt;x + 200&gt;);
</pre>

        <p>
            The only difference is in the compiled code.
        </p>
        <pre>
console.log(200 + 200);
</pre>
        <pre>
console.log(400);
</pre>
        <p>
            The difference here occurs because in the second example, 200 + 200 was cooked; evaluated at compile time instead of runtime.

            You will need to be careful though, or you could end up with something like the following:
        </p>
        <pre>
console.log($&lt;Math.random()&gt;); <comment>// Once compiled, the "random" value will always be the same.</comment>
</pre>
        <p>Or worse,</p>
        <pre>
const x = 200;
console.log($&lt;x + 200&gt;); <comment>// The compiler will throw an error as 'x' is not defined at compile-time.</comment>
</pre>
    </div>
</body>
